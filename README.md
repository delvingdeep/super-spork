# super-spork
This is my C++ repository, containing some basic to application specific C++ program

#### To run a program

Run following command:

C++ file needs to be complied first before execution.

For this a IDE like `Atom`, `Sublime`, `CodeBlocks`, etc. can be used
or
Compliers like `g++` or `gcc` can also be used.

For `g++`:
```
$ g++ codefile_name.cpp -o output_name
$ ./output_name
```

For `gcc`:
```
$ gcc codefile_name.cpp -o output_name
$ ./output_name
```
Here the `-o` makes the file to be an output file  and `output_name` is the complied file for our C++ program file.
